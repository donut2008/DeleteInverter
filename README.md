# DeleteInverter
An app which deletes files except ones marked by the user as exclusions.

## Why did I make this?
I was attempting to get the fingerprint sensor working on my Galaxy A30s which was running a ported One UI ROM using [this guide](https://xdaforums.com/t/samsung-fingerprint-fix-on-ported-roms.4640902/). Although it did not work, the number of files which were to be copied over was massive and I had to painstakingly copy all of those files over (just to see a broken fingerprint sensor) one by one.

This app solves the problem by letting you add a list of exclusions before deleting files. (You'll have to make a copy of the folder, in case you need it later for whatever reason.)

## Why is it so incomplete?
Yes.

## Can I make a feature request?
Sure! You can create a new issue tagged "feature request" or, if you have already implemented the feature, create a pull request. I'll review the PR before merging it.

# Enjoy!
